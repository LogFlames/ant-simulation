# Ant-Simulation
## An upper secondary school project
This is a last year project done at [Norra Real](https://norrarealsgymnasium.stockholm.se/) in Stockholm.

## Running
The project should be setup correctly. To run the code simply clone the repo, open the solution in VS2019 with C++ Desktop Development installed and run the code. Dependencies are only included for Windows but since it is written in c++ and OpenGL, it should be possible to run cross-plattform.
