# Ant-Simulation
## A diploma project
This is a last year project done at [Norra Real](https://norrarealsgymnasium.stockholm.se/) in Stockholm. The report can be [read here](Gyarb_2021___N__A__Dahlfors_och_E__Lundell.pdf), as well as in the repository.

## Running
The project should be setup correctly. To run the code simply clone the repo, open the solution in VS2019 with C++ Desktop Development installed and run the code. Dependencies are only included for Windows but since it is written in c++ and OpenGL, it should be possible to run cross-plattform.

## Creating Maps
The maps are images where specific pixel values hold key information. The current values are (0-255):
* Walls | r: 128, g: 128, b: 128
* Home  | r: 100, g: 100, b: 100
* Food  | r: 255, g: 0, b: 0
